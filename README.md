ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME

Thank you for your interest on my game. This is a program based on the well-known game of Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS)- with implementation using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

INSTALLATION

You may clone the repository, and then open the index.html file. 
Repository here: https://github.com/barrajac/rock-paper-scissors-game.git

HOW TO USE

Open the link in a broswer. When the game has loaded, you will see a Start Screen where you can read the instructions and click "Play" to begin.

GAME RULES

This take on RPS is a two-player game, where one player is the user, and the second player is the "Computer". The goal is to win five RPS rounds before the other player in order to win the game. 

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

This iteration of RPS was built using HTML, CSS, and Javavascript with DOM manipulation. The game is noteable with a simple, yet aesthetically friendly, graphical user interface (GUI). The layout includes a start and reset screen, a compact scoreboard, three visual clickable choices, and confirmation of what each player chose for each round. The players take turns in choosing either rock, paper, or scissors by way of clicking on the corresponding images. 

ROADMAP

Possible stretch-goals to attempt:
  - implementing an option for a second player instead of computer
  - implementing a high score tracker
  - implementing an name input feature that would update the scoreboard badge for player to their input
  - making the game well-adatped to mobile in addition to desktop computer
  - adding optional music with each play
  - optimizing formatting
  
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

RPS is considered the oldest game in the world that is played with your hands. This was inspiring to learn. This is also a "programming-ode", so to speak, to first attempt I had in practicing writing pseudocode.
